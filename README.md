# Task 6: Model Performance Comparison

This notebook is part of my AI & ML internship.  
In this task, I focused on comparing different machine learning models to understand their performance on the same datadet.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- [Add any other libraries if used]

## What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset.
- Preprocessed data to handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- Implemented multiple machine learning models using scikit-learn.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluated each model using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- Visualized the comparison results using graphs.

## What I Learned
- How to train multiple models on the same dataset.
- How to choose suitable evaluation metrics.
- The impact of preprocessing on different algorithms.
- How to interpret and present model comparison results.

This task helped me develop a better understanding of selecting the best model for a given problem based on performance metrics.  
Feel free to check out the notebook and suggest improvements!
